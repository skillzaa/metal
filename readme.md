# Metal (or the metal99 as its npm name)

- Metail is a 2d drawing library for Javascript.
- We have functions like drawText , drawRectangle etc. These functions will draw an object based upon a bunch or attributes passed to thse functions.
- We pass variables to these functions using an array of objects (in this case called attributes). This array is just a bundle of objects which are all name value pairs.
